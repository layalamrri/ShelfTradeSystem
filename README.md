Shelf Trade-project
Shelf Trade is an online platform designed to facilitate book exchanges, providing an easy and sustainable alternative to purchasing new books. Users can create accounts, list books they want to trade, search for available books, and send exchange requests. The platform features a notification system to inform users about the status of their requests and a rating system to build trust within the community. Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the website ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience. Users can filter books by category, view detailed descriptions, and connect with other readers to exchange books effortlessly. The project follows the Scrum methodology and is managed using Jira for task tracking and collaboration. To run the project locally, users need to clone the repository, set up the database, and configure the necessary files. The Shelf Trade team consists of a Product Owner, Developers, and a Scrum Master, all working together to create an efficient and reliable book exchange system.
